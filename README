The Hutchinson Drought Index

The Hutchinson Drought Index (or Drought Severity Index) is a climatic drought index 
that was designed to reflect agricultural droughts using only rainfall data.

The index was invented by Professor Mike Hutchinson at the ANU in 1992 and this project includes 
R codes written by Ivan Hanigan to describe the calculations and also to download data to play with.

Casual readers will probably want to go straight to 
~/reports/HutchinsonDroughtIndex_transformations_doc.pdf

Readers wishing to reproduce the data analysis can do so by running the 'go.r' script
(see the Specification.txt file for explanations of the structure of the code).
