The Hutchinson Drought Index

The drought index was invented by Professor Mike Hutchinson at the ANU. 
This project includes R codes to describe the calculations and 
also to download dummy data to play with.

The REPORTS directory contains the Sweave file and output pdf,
the RUN directory contains the Tangled R code as seperate scripts
(for easier source()ing).
