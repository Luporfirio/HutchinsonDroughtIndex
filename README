The Hutchinson Drought Index

The Hutchinson Drought Index (or Drought Severity Index) is a climatic drought index 
that was designed to reflect agricultural droughts using only rainfall data.

The index was invented by Professor Mike Hutchinson at the ANU: 
Smith, D. I, Hutchinson, M. F, & McArthur, R. J. (1992) Climatic and
Agricultural Drought: Payments and Policy. (Centre for Resource and Environmental
Studies, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia).

This project includes R codes to describe the calculations and 
also to download dummy data to play with.

Casual readers will probably want to go straight to 
~/reports/HutchinsonDroughtIndex_transformations_doc.pdf

Readers wishing to reproduce the data analysis can do so by running the 'go.r' script
(see the Specification.txt file for explanations of the structure of the code).
