The Hutchinson Drought Index

The Hutchinson Drought Index (or Drought Severity Index) is a climatic drought index 
that was designed to reflect agricultural droughts using only rainfall data.

The index was invented by Professor Mike Hutchinson at the ANU. 
This project includes R codes to describe the calculations and 
also to download dummy data to play with.

Specification:
This project is designed in two parts: a RUN directory and a REPORTS directory.
The RUN directory is built using another function I am developing called 'newnode' 
which I use behind the scenes to create the RUN files and the Sweave file concurrently.

To explain:
 - I wanted to adopt a modular workflow based on Josh Reich's 'Load, Clean, Func, Do' 
   workflow cf stackoverflow.
 - I've renamed the modules 'tools, load, clean, do' and store in the RUN directory.
 - I've added a 'go' script in the root dir to source the RUN files.
 - The REPORTS directory contains the Sweave file and output figures/tables to be inserted.
 - I do not evaluate the R codes in the Sweave file, rather I use it to produce a report of 
   the operations of the RUN files.
 - the RUN directory can be thought of as the Tangled R code embedded in the Sweave file. 

I find having the RUN files as separate scripts rather than a single Sweave file easier 
when inserting new work steps (and then just source()ing the relevant module using 'go').

It also seems easier when collaborating with others; to help them navigate to specific 
workflow steps that otherwise seem to be entangled in an ad hoc sequence in the Sweave file 
(due to the evolutionary process of conducting data management and analyses).
For example the 'check' steps can occur periodically in between 'load' and 'do' steps, 
but a reader may not be concerned with replicating these after the workflow development 
is completed.
